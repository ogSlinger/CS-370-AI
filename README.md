# CS-370-AI

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this assignment, we trained a machine learning algorithm to solve a maze. In cell 9 of the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), that is where the assignment had us create the code needed to train the model. We were given the psuedocode as a starting point and had to create the functionality from it.


## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

This course connects to the field of computer science in a larger scope is the concept of problem solving with computational devices. In this instance, we leverage algorithms to train a neural network to solve different kinds of tasks. Some was recognizing numbers, or various objects, to even solving the maze in the end. Much like a lot of things in computer science, the approaches taken to solve the issues were taught iteratively through learning and practical application.


## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists make attempts to utilize computers to solve problems. These problems can come from a wide variety of fields and industries. These problems typically require a lot of computational power that can be done in a quick rate.


## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching a problem in computer science typically starts with the decomposition of the problem. One looks at the requirements that the problem poses onto the scientist. Then, with the framework and requirements laid out, various possible solutions can be explored. Then, through an iterative approach, a solution can be found and optimized.


## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

For anything related to private, the end user's data must be as secure as possible. Making sure data gets encrypted to the point where it cannot be recognized or identifiable comes first. Also, as a computer scientist, one needs to consider the implications of technology on humanity. Fully understanding previous impacts and potential future ones help those make educated decisions on how to develop newer technologies. In the example of the emergence of AI, researchers need to consider how the advancement of the technology may impact others.
